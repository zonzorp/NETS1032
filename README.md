# Resources for NETS1032 - Digital Forensics

## Course Information
This course is part of the INSS program at Georgian College. The course outline is updated periodically and kept available online via the [Georgian College website](https://georgiancollege.ca). There is also a course syllabus with the details for each semester kept on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for the course. Course communications, announcements, schedules, assignment submission links, and testing are conducted using [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com).
There is no textbook for this course. Online videos and documentation provide the reference material.
We use multiple operating systems for our lab exercises and it is expected that students will run them in virtual machines under [VMWare](https://vmware.com) for which the college provides a license. Students are expected to be familiar with VMWare and virtual machines.

## Overview
The field of digital forensics is rapidly evolving. The software tools and companies are also rapidly changing, merging, selling out, etc. This site provides links to companies, software, and organizations and is updated continuously while the course is being taught. An example link list that is actively maintained and covers much more than the list of topics in this course can found at [https://github.com/0x4D31/awesome-threat-detection](https://github.com/0x4D31/awesome-threat-detection). The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) is an excellent resource to use when examining an existing deployment to identify concerns.
