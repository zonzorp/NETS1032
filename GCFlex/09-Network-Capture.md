# Capturing Data from a network

## Introduction
This module provides some conceptual and practical information on processes, tools, and considerations for doing captures of network traffic, commonly called sniffing the network.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this module, students will:
   * Identify the effects of network implementation on the potential for capturing network traffic
   * Learn the most common usage of tools for capturing interesting traffic from the network
   * Demonstrate using network traffic tools to identify and capture desired network traffic or prove the absence of it

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the Course Outline.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to working with live memory investigations and capturewd memory images.
You should have:
   * Learned to identify the effects of network implementation on the potential for capturing network traffic
   * Learned the most common usage of tools for capturing interesting traffic from the network
   * Demonstrated using network traffic tools to identify and capture desired network traffic or prove the absence of it

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to both Linux and Windows.
