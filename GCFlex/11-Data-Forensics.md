# Data Forensics, or How Not To Be Seen

## Introduction
This module provides some conceptual and practical information on data forensics and focuses on steganography.

For your lab work, ensure you have access to both a Linux desktop environment with root, and a Windows desktop with Administrator. You will be showing your work to the professor throughout the semester, so you will need to be able to share your lab system screen, and the lab system you use will need to be clearly identified as your own (you should use your own name for the login, or at least something unique to you). No marks will be given for showing work on a lab system which is not your own.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this module, students will:
   * Become familiar with specific tools for hiding information, known as steganographic tools
   * Demonstrate using steganographic tools to hide and extract data from stego files
   * Learn about the limitations of doing investigations when steganography is in use

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the Course Outline.

## Graded Activity
The lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded, and when you need to be capturing screenshots during the lab.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, we worked with capturted network data to identify and extract artifacts of interest to a forensic investigation.
You should have:
   * Become familiar with specific tools for hiding information, known as steganographic tools
   * Demonstrated using steganographic tools to hide and extract data from stego files
   * Gained an understanding of some of the limitations of doing investigations when steganography is in use

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to both Linux and Windows.
