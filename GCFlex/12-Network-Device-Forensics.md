# Network Device Forensics


## Introduction
This module provides some conceptual and practical information on doing forensic investigations of network devices, in particular infrastructure devices such as routers.

For your lab work, ensure you have access to both a Linux desktop environment with root, and a Windows desktop with Administrator. You will be showing your work to the professor throughout the semester, so you will need to be able to share your lab system screen, and the lab system you use will need to be clearly identified as your own (you should use your own name for the login, or at least something unique to you). No marks will be given for showing work on a lab system which is not your own.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this module, students will:
   * Become familiar with the particular challenges of doing investigations on network devices
   * Demonstrate using investigative techniques to analyze the state of network devices with respect to whether they have been compromised

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 1, 2, and 3 in the Course Outline.

## Graded Activity
The lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded, and when you need to be capturing screenshots during the lab.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, we worked with network device configuration information identify suspicious changes to devices and extract artifacts of interest to a forensic investigation.
You should have:
   * Become familiar with the particular challenges of doing investigations on network devices
   * Demonstrated using investigative techniques to analyze the state of network devices with respect to whether they have been compromised

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to both Linux and Windows.
