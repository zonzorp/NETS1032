# Introduction to Digital Forensics

## Introduction
This is the first lesson in the NETS1032 Digital Forensics course. It is expected to be completed in week 1 of the course, with the quiz due before the start of the next class. Additionally you are expected to have the ability to run a Linux desktop environment such as Ubuntu and a Windows 10 desktop on your own equipment before the next class.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
  * describe what digital forensics encompasses
  * describe the principles and uses of digital forensics
  * describe the forensic process as well as the actors and the authorizations that may be required
  * describe considerations for evidence gathering
  * recognize the different types of digital forensic activity
  * demonstrate awareness of organizations which are relevant to digital forensics

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 1, 2, and 5 in the Course Outline.

## To do List
   * Read through the [Introduction to Digital Forensics Presentation in PDF format](Presentations/NETS1032-21W-01-IntroToDigitalForensics.pdf)
   * Watch the videos mentioned in the presentation
      * [ISACA Overview of Digital Forensics - A video to start you thinking about the use of digital forensics in law enforcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUqzcQc_syE)
      * [The computer forensic investigation process - Specific to forensic activities supporting legal proceedings, part of CISSP prep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmuhGa4QekU)
      * [John Oliver's Last Week Tonight episode covering forensic evidence and the use of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScmJvmzDcG0)
   * Watch the recorded video of the presentation found in the general chat of the Microsoft Team for this course if you did not attend the class when it was presented
   * Review the lesson materials linked below
   * Perform the learning activities as described below
   * Do the quiz found under Tests on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) for this topic

## Learning Activity
Watch the videos from the presentation.
Follow the instructions for [Lab Systems Setup Assignment](Labs/Lab01-Lab-System-Setup.md) which gets you ready for the rest of the assignments in this course.

## Graded Activity
When you have the 2 lab VMs ready for use, you will be ready for the next class. There is nothing to submit, and no marks assigned to setting up your 2 VMs for this course. If you do not have them set up, you will be unable to do the rest of the labs in this course which do count for marks.

## Quiz
The quiz is found on [Blackboard](https://gc.blackboard.com) under Assignments and Tests.

## Test
There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to digital forensics.
You should now be aware of:
  * Types of forensic activity and evidence collection considerations
  * Roles, processes, and rules involved in digital forensics
  * Considerations related to law when digital forensics is done

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you need to have your computing environment available with access to both Linux and Windows.
