# Working with Microsoft Filesystems Images

## Introduction
This lesson provides some conceptual and practical information on processes, tools, and considerations for working with captured images of Microsoft Filesystems.

For your lab work, ensure you have access to both a Linux desktop environment with root, and a Windows desktop with Administrator. You will be showing your work to the professor throughout the semester, so you will need to be able to share your lab system screen, and the lab system you use will need to be clearly identified as your own (you should use your own name for the login, or at least something unique to you). No marks will be given for showing work on a lab system which is not your own.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will:
   * Understand what Microsoft Filesystems Contain, including metadata
   * Begin to explore the kinds of artifacts that might be of interest in Microsoft Filesystems
   * Begin using tools for Analyzing Microsoft Filesystem Images
   * Demonstrate using Autopsy to work with metadata and deleted files
   * Demonstrate using ProDiscover to find evidence
   * Demonstrate finding information in a Microsoft filesystem image using Access Data's registry viewer

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 2, 3, 4, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## Graded Activity
The lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded, and when you need to be capturing screenshots during the lab.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to working with Microsoft filesystems images.
You should now be:
* Aware of the uses and limitations of selected forensic tools for investigating Microsoft Filesystem Images
* Familiar with the kinds of evidence that can be found in a Microsoft filesystem
* Capable of selecting tools for working with Microsoft filesystems images, both hardware and software

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to both Linux and Windows.
