# Working with Linux Filesystem Images

## Introduction
This lesson provides some conceptual and practical information on processes, tools, and considerations for working with captured images of Linux Filesystems.

For your lab work, ensure you have access to both a Linux desktop environment with root, and a Windows desktop with Administrator. You will be showing your work to the professor throughout the semester, so you will need to be able to share your lab system screen, and the lab system you use will need to be clearly identified as your own (you should use your own name for the login, or at least something unique to you). No marks will be given for showing work on a lab system which is not your own.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, students will:
   * Understand what Linux Filesystem Images Contain, including metadata
   * Begin to explore the kinds of artifacts that might be of interest in Linux Filesystem Images
   * Begin using tools for Analyzing Linux Filesystem Images
   * Demonstrate using Linux forensic analysis tools to work with metadata and deleted files in Linux Filesystem Images

These objectives are in support of Learning Outcomes 2, 3, 4, and 6 in the Course Outline.

## Graded Activity
The lab instructions tell you what parts of the lab activity are graded, and when you need to be capturing screenshots during the lab.

## Quiz

The quiz is found on Blackboard under Assignments and Tests.

## Test

There is no separate test for this topic. The quiz will count for your testing mark in this topic.

## Summary
In this module, you have been introduced to working with Linux filesystems images.
You should now be:
* Aware of the uses and limitations of selected forensic tools for investigating Linux Filesystem Images
* Familiar with the kinds of evidence that can be found in a Linux filesystem
* Capable of selecting tools for working with Linux filesystems images, both hardware and software

Completing the quiz will provide you with a measure of your knowledge in these areas. For the next class you should have your computing environment available with access to both Linux and Windows.
